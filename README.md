My first proper project posted to github.
 
## Random ~Quote~ Exercise Generator

#### I thought I would do something practical & make a random exercise generator.
##### It will either generate a random cardio based exercise or a random compound exercise
###### For the cardio exercises, you will have the total time of the exercise and the ratio. For instance Sprints for 5 min and a 30sec 2/1 ratio. So you will do 1min(30secx2)exercise and rest for 30sec(30x1)

###### The cardio exercises are only finished once the exercise/rest set has been completed(even if the time is done).(this is if you are actually gonna do it haha)

### Examples:
>Do Power Pushaways: 3 sets of 6 reps each
>
>Do Push-ups: 2 sets of 13 reps each
>
>Do Sprints: 3 minutes total, exercise duration 39 seconds ; 3 exercise/1 rest ratio
>
>Do Ammo Cans: 4 minutes total, exercise duration 42 seconds ; 4 exercise/2 rest ratio
